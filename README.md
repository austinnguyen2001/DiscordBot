# DiscordBot
## Current Features
- Ability to start contest (counts down until end time)
- Link discord and twitch accounts via oauth 
(although I need to migrate it over to rethinkdb first)
## How to run 

### First start
```
npm install
npm run setup (after setup is complete the bot will automatically begin running)
* changed db to rethink so there might be some startup bugs for now
```

### Sequential stars
```
npm start
```
